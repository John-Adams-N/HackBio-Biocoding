## Introduction

Welcome to the HackBio-Biocoding repository! This repository contains a collection of scripts and resources used during the bioinformatics internship program. The program is divided into different stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of bioinformatics.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

HackBio-Biocoding:
## Stage 0: Biodata submission

## Stage 1: DNA to Protein translation & Population growth curve generation and analysis
Summary of Stage 1
DNA to Protein Translation
Logistic Growth Model
Multiple Growth Curve Generation
Finding Time to Reach 80% of Carrying Capacity
Example Usage for demonstration

## Stage 2: (a) Amino acid Mutation analysis
Step 1: Data Importation
Load both datasets: SIFT Dataset and FoldX Dataset into a data processing environment (e.g., Python using Pandas).
Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation
Identify relevant columns in both datasets (Protein, Amino_acid, SIFT Score, FoldX Score).
Create a new column, specific_Protein_aa, in both datasets.
This column should be a concatenation of Protein and Amino_acid (e.g., "A5A607_E63D").
Ensure the new column has a consistent format (no trailing spaces, missing values, or inconsistent capitalization).
Step 3: Data Merging
Merge the two datasets using the specific_Protein_aa column as a key.
The resulting dataset should contain:
Protein, Amino_acid, SIFT Score, FoldX Score, and specific_Protein_aa.
Step 4: Identify Deleterious Mutations
Filter for mutations that:
Have a SIFT Score below 0.05 (Functionally deleterious).
Have a FoldX Score above 2 kCal/mol (Structurally destabilizing).
Store this filtered dataset separately for further analysis.
Step 5: Investigate Amino Acid Impact
Extract the first amino acid from the Amino_acid column (e.g., from "E63D", extract "E").
Count how frequently each amino acid appears in the deleterious mutations.
Identify the amino acid with the most occurrences.
Step 6: Generate Frequency Analysis
Create a frequency table for all amino acids based on their impact.
Summarize the total occurrences for each amino acid.
Step 7: Data Visualization
Use the frequency table to generate:
A bar plot showing the frequency of each amino acid.
A pie chart visualizing the distribution of amino acid impacts.   
##          (b) Pharmacokinetics RNA Seq Data Analysis
Summary of Transcriptomics Analysis
1. Introduction
The dataset contains data from an RNA-seq experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X.
Objective: Analyze RNA-seq gene expression data to assess the impact of Compound X on diseased cell lines.
Dataset: Includes gene expression data (log2FoldChange, p-value, and adjusted p-value (padj)).
3. Data Processing & Cleaning
Data Import: Fetched dataset from an online source and converted it from TXT to CSV for better readability.
Loading & Inspection: Checked the dataset structure, missing values, and column names.
Key Findings:
No missing values were detected.
The dataset contained 4 columns: Gene, log2FoldChange, p-value, and padj.
4. Differential Gene Expression Analysis 
Upregulated Genes: Genes with log2FoldChange > 1 and p-value < 0.01.
Downregulated Genes: Genes with log2FoldChange < -1 and p-value < 0.01.
Key Findings:
Identified several significantly upregulated and downregulated genes.
Saved these genes to separate CSV files for further exploration.
5. Visualization & Interpretation
Volcano Plot: Showed significantly upregulated and downregulated genes.
Bar Plot: Compared gene expression changes.
Density Plot: Visualized the distribution of log2FoldChange values.
6. Biological Insights & Next Steps
Top genes (e.g., DOK6, TBX5, SLC32A1, IFITM1) were analyzed using GeneCards for their biological roles.
Insights from this analysis could inform potential therapeutic targets and further research directions.
ðŸš€ Conclusion: Successfully processed, analyzed, and visualized transcriptomics data, revealing key genes affected by Compound X!

## Stage 3: Machine Learning for Cancer type classification

## Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You may also need to install some additional Python packages. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each stage contains a set of scripts that perform specific bioinformatics tasks. To run a script, navigate to the appropriate stage directory and execute the script using Python. For example:

```bash
cd Stage1
python Script1.py
```
