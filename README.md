## Introduction

Welcome to the HackBio-Biocoding repository! This repository contains a collection of scripts and resources used during the bioinformatics internship program. The program is divided into different stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of bioinformatics.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

HackBio-Biocoding:
## Stage 0: Biodata submission
## Stage 1: (a) DNA to Protein translation, (b) Population growth curve generation and analysis
## Stage 3: (a) Amino acid Mutation analysis, (b) Pharmacokinetics RNA Seq Data Analysis
## Stage 4: Machine Learning for Cancer type classification

## Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You may also need to install some additional Python packages. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
